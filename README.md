The game is a 2D adventure developed using the Godot game engine and C# language. The rooms of the game are stored as a JSON file. 
It is centered around an apprentice mage being tested by their master. The setting is in a tower set up as a challenge for the apprentice. Two spells are available: one to fire a shot and one to produce light. The player has health. Running out of health is a game over. If the player fails, they are a disappointment. 
The first puzzle has the player open a locked door, which the player can not break. To unlock it, the player must retrieve two hidden keys. 
The second puzzle is hitting a target in a dark room. The darkness hides a switch, so the player has to illuminate the place to find it. When the switch is flipped, a target will show. Once the player hits the target, the next room opens.
The final challenge is defeating a straw dummy enchanted by the apprenticeâ€™s master. It is stationary and only throws balls of straw.
